This directory will be populated with Jupyter notebooks of the exercise sessions
as the course progresses. These notebooks contain *solutions* to the exercise
sheets, and additional material not covered in the main lectures. Exercise
sheets can be found in the parallel `exercises/` directory.

Notebook files will be pushed to the main ESC403 repo
(http://github.com/esc403/esc403); in order to have them appear in forked
repositories too, you will need to periodically merge the main repo into yours::

    # assuming that the `upstream` remote points to https://github.com/esc403/esc403
    git merge upstream

----

Some additional data files are distributed here to allow re-running the
playbooks on students' laptops:

* `Y2H_union.tsv`: The `Y2H_union.txt` file from the "Yeast Interactome"
  collection produced by [CCSB](http://ccsb.dfci.harvard.edu/)
  See <http://interactome.dfci.harvard.edu/S_cerevisiae/index.php?page=home> for
  details.
